# Data_Encryption_Standard
Cryptography/DES Implementation:  In the field of cryptography when there was an early stage DES (Data Encryption Standard) was introduced to encrypt and decrypt any message, files, or any kind of information.  This was a symmetric key algorithm (Only one key for both encryption and decryption purposes). I have implemented this Algorithm using C++ for encoding the binary message (if a message is in ASCII characters we will first convert it to binary and then will encrypt) using DES with a 64-bit key.
